# operators      

- (+):    symbolizes the sum of the operator.
- (-):    symbolizes the subtraction of the operator.
- (%):    symbolizes the module and the remainder of the operator.
- ((=)<): symbolizes to compare values ​​and variables less than or equal.
- (>(=)): symbolizes to compare values ​​and variables greater than or equal.
- (!=):   symbolizes to compare that they are not equal values ​​and variables.
- (==):   symbolizes to compare values ​​or variables equal.
- (?):    ternary operator to make comparisons.
- (&):    operator for pointers and with a boolean operator function that represents "AND".
- (*):    operator to perform multiplications and with function to put variables with pointer.

***

# Loops

- For: loop to condition it and how it progresses with variables
- while /do: loop to condition it and if it is fulfilled the loop is closed
Do while it works first to comply with an instruction, then it proceeds to enter the loop
- if/else: decision that determines if the value is true or false and certain conditions are met
- switch: multiple decisions if the condition is met, and stops with break:

# variables:
- int: represents a variable of type integer

- doble:represents a float but with longer memory length

- float: represents a floating type variable

- char: represents a variable of type characters


- *ptr: pointer type variable

- static: static type variables that are maintained throughout the program

- dynamic: dynamic type variable that varies during the program execution

- void: means it does not return values.

***

# memory dynamic

- Malloc:  allocates a piece of memory for pointer type variables

- Calloc:  allocates a piece of memory for variables started from a value of 0 of type pointers

- Realloc: possibly returns a pointer to the moved allocated space

- Free:    frees memory of previous parameters

***

# general

- ascii: alphanumeric character encoding

- include: preprocesses preloaded system libraries and serves as input and output functions

- \n: line break

- \t: tabulator

- <stdio.h>: main library of the program

- <stdlib.h>: library with extra functions for handling arrays and others


- <math.h>: library to use mathematics

- <string.h>: library for handling strings

- ("): for handling char values

- []: to initialize arrays

- ; end program processes

- {}: for the initialization and end of processes within the program

- Argc:counter array argument

- Argv: array argument type vector

- Define: preprocesses a constant with a floating-type value during program execution

- string: variable strings

***

# Funtion

- Funtion: variable strings

- printf: actuate to show an output value on the screen

- scanf:  receives input values ​​from keyboard

- return: returns values ​​of functions

- continue: continue the looping process

- break: stops the looping process

- strcmp: compare a string

- fopen: open archive file

- fclose: close the archive file

# Arithmetic

- ** : Exponentiation of values.

- *: multiplication of values

- +: addition of values

- -: substration of values

- %: modulus of remainder of a divition:

- /:  division of a value

***

# General

- print(): show data input to a output monitor

- input(): receive data from a keyboard as a string

- range(): produce numbers within a range.

- import: used to import modules.

- []: Icreates an object list

- .append(): add the value to the end of a list

- .pop(): remove the value from the end fo a list.

- (): converts a list to a tuple.

- #: insert a comment inside of a program

- lower(): convert a string to lower

- upper(): convert a string to upper

- len(): to get the length of a string

- def(): define a function

-"AND": operator that works if two values are true

-"or": operator if one values is true

-"not": operator if all values are false

# Loops

- For: works with lists and works like a other languages

- while: execute until a condition is done

- if/else: to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not.
